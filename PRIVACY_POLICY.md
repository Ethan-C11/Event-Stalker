# Privacy Policy – Event Stalker

_Last updated: 20 January 2026_

Event Stalker (“the Bot”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the data you provide while using the Bot on Discord.

## 1. Information We Collect

Event Stalker only collects the minimal information required to function:

- **Discord User ID** (to send notifications if you subscribe)
- **Server ID & Channel ID** (to know where to post events)
- **Event IDs** (to prevent duplicate notifications)
- Optional: **command interactions** for slash commands

> Event Stalker does **not** access or store your messages, voice data, or other personal information.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The data collected is used solely for:

- Sending event notifications to the correct Discord channel
- Preventing duplicate event postings
- Supporting slash commands (`/events`, `/scan`, etc.)
- Improving bot functionality (logs only, no personal data)

## 3. Data Sharing

Event Stalker does **not** sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.

> The only exception is automated event fetching from public APIs (e.g., HelloAsso), which is strictly read-only.

## 4. Data Storage

- Event IDs and server configuration are stored locally.
- Data is retained only as long as the bot is running on your server.
- You can request deletion of your server’s data by contacting the bot maintainer.

## 5. Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the data collected. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here with the date updated.
